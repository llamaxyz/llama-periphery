# Llama Token Voting

Llama Token Voting is extensions to Llama instances. They allow token holders to create actions and collectively cast approvals or disapprovals. The LlamaTokenGovernor contract follows established token voting framework best practices and is designed to integrate directly with instances.

Llama Token Voting consists of two components:

- [Token Governor](/docs/token-voting/TokenGovernor.md)

- [Token Voting Factory](/docs/token-voting/Factory.md)
