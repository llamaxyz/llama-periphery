# Llama Token Voting

Token voting modules are extensions to Llama instances. They allow token holders to create actions and collectively cast approvals or disapprovals. The LlamaTokenGovernor contract follows established token voting framework best practices and is designed to integrate directly with instances.

The token voting module consists of two components:

- [Token Governor](/docs/token-voting/TokenGovernor.md)

- [Token Voting Factory](/docs/token-voting/Factory.md)
